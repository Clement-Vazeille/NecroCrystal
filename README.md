# Necrocrystal
A game made in C++ with the SFML library.
The game is about 10 minutes long and the goal is to finish it as fast as possible, there is a timer to see how much time you take to complete the game.
There is a ingame tutorial that shows the keys binding.

It's a game in which you control a necromancer and fight waves of enemies. Each time you beat an enemy, he will become a skeleton who will help you, making you stronger.

As you will defeat waves of enemies, you'll go deeper in the dungeon and will face tougher foes.
